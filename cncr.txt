 Objective One: Build a Tiberium Refinery.
 Objective Two: Build a Barracks.
 Objective Three: Destroy all Nod forces.
|
The Nod forces that attacked Phoenix Base have been traced back to a small base in this sector. Orders received from GDI Command state that the Nod base must be destroyed. However, there is a significant civilian population in the immediate area that must be evacuated by ORCA Transport before the fighting gets too heavy. Before the Transports can safely land, all seven SAM sites must be destroyed. Once the civilians have been evacuated, the Nod base can be destroyed.

 Objective One: Deploy the M.C.V. and begin building a base.
 Objective Two: Destroy all Nod SAM sites.
 Objective Three: Destroy the Nod base.
|
GDI forces in this sector have found something unusual and large that crashed nearby. Nod has taken an intense interest in whatever it is, so naturally we are interested as well.

|
The hydroelectric dams in this area provide Vega's island fortress with almost limitless power. Destroying the dams will seriously cripple Vega's perimeter defenses and allow GDI to bring more weapons to bear against Vega's base.

The dams are heavily fortified, so attacking them directly is not the best option. Surveillance indicates the key to destroying the dams lies in the destruction of two regulator stations. Without them, the dams' generators will overload and the dams will self destruct.

Objective One: Destroy the dams any way possible.
| 
|

|
The alien craft is located in this region. FIND IT! The area is infested with GDI, so stealth would be to your advantage. Once the craft is located get an engineer inside to retrieve the Tacitus. And, should you encounter Vega's forces - consider them expendable.

 Objective One: Locate the crashed UFO and retrieve Kane's artifacts.
 Objective Two: Stop the transport of the Tacitus at all costs.
|
Control of the mutants is in our grasp. Their headquarters is located to the north of your drop-off position. The units you will need to implicate GDI in this deception can be obtained by capturing the rest of the GDI base that you will start in. Do not mar the Brotherhoods name any further. Allow the blame to fall squarely upon Solomon's shoulders.

 Objective One: Capture the enemy Construction Yard awaiting you.

 Objective Two: Use GDI units to destroy the mutant's base.
|
You must reach the medical colony in the region without being prematurely detected by GDI and forcing a base evacuation. To prevent this, consider first destroying the three sensor towers protecting the base. Our new artillery unit should be sufficient for the job. Once inside the base, the capture of the mutant female should be easy.

 Objective One: Find and destroy the GDI sensor towers without getting too close and getting detected by them.

 Objective Two: Once the towers are destroyed, move on the base and capture the medical colony before Umagon, the Mutant, can escape.
|
The mutant female may be trying to reach the underground railway system located in New Detroit. Move in and control the station before she arrives. If she boards the train then it must be stopped. This may be our last chance at capturing the abomination.

 Objective One: Locate the train station in the area and capture it before Umagon flies in and boards the train to escape into the underground.

 Objective Two: If Umagon boards the train before you have captured the station then you must stop the train before it leaves the region. Destroy the locomotive and we will be able to capture Umagon.

 Objective Three: Locate the research facility.
 Objective Four: Destroy the research facility.
|
Nod forces were recently forced out of this area. However, spies report that the Nod bio-toxin facility has not yet been destroyed by GDI troops. The Cyborg Commando and his team should be able to slip through the main GDI force and recover two tankers full of bio-toxin - provided we act quickly.

 Objective One: Locate the bio-toxin trucks.
 Objective Two: Escort the trucks to the checkpoint east of the base.
|
The Cyborg Commando has been sent in to retrieve you. Once free, rendezvous with your rescue team to the south. Use them to locate and free Oxanna.

After she has been freed, commandeer a GDI transport to make your escape.

 Objective One: Locate and free Oxanna.
 Objective Two: Steal a GDI transport to make an escape.
|
The Nod base in this sector has been overrun by Tiberium life forms. Weedeaters have proven to be effective against the Tiberium creatures, but we must move reinforcements in quickly before the base is completely destroyed. Once the situation has been stabilized, the GDI base in the area must be eliminated.

 Objective One: Locate and secure the old base.
 Objective Two: Destroy the GDI base.
|
The road through this sector is a vital supply link. If a foothold is firmly established and a Tiberium Waste Facility is built, Nod chemical missiles can be launched from the region. The GDI base in the area has no defense against the missiles, and can be destroyed at your leisure once the waste convoys start arriving.

 Objective One: Establish a base and build a Tiberium Waste Facility.
 Objective Two: Destroy the GDI base.
|
GDI is set to test the prototype of their new weapon, the Mammoth Mark II. It is vital that we sabotage their production of this monster as soon as possible. Before we can do that however, we need to know where the test is being held. Send a Chameleon Spy into one of the Radar Facilities. The coordinates to the testing ground should be stored there. Be careful of the patrols in the area - we have only one spy available. Once we have the location of the test, construct a base and destroy the prototype. You now have access to the new Banshee aircraft, which should prove useful. Destroying the remainder of the GDI base is at your discretion, but the Mammoth MUST be destroyed.

 Objective One: Spy on one of the GDI Comm Centers.
 Objective Two: Destroy the Mammoth Mark II prototype.
|
Jake McNeil, brother of one of GDI's commanders, will be leading an inspection tour to a small GDI outpost in this area. His knowledge of GDI activities could be of great benefit to Nod's cause. Capture the GDI outpost with engineers, then disguise the base as GDI's and wait for Jake to make his inspection. When the signal is given, use the Toxin soldiers provided to "persuade" Jake to join Nod's forces. Once he is under our influence, EVAC him at the designated site.

Be very careful not to alert GDI until we are ready to strike. If they detect Nod forces in the area, they will surely try to evacuate Jake. If GDI is alerted, be sure to get to Jake before he can leave the area.

 Objective One: Capture the GDI outpost.
 Objective Two: Capture Jake.
 Objective Three: EVAC Jake at the specified location.
|
In order for our ICBMs to shoot down the Philadelphia, they must be able to triangulate the station's position. Our spies have placed beacons at the optimal deployment locations. Once the launchers have been moved to the beacons, the station's fate is sealed and the Temple of Nod may be built. Move with all due haste. If the Philadelphia is able to complete three orbits, it will lock onto our position and destroy Kane's plans.

 Objective One: Deploy ICBM launchers at the three beacons.
|
GDI has stored the firing codes for its Ion Cannon in three separate Comm centers. The centers are isolated in a valley and poorly guarded. We do not have the forces available for a full-scale assault. However, a small infiltration team led by the Chameleon Spy has a reasonable chance of success. Once the Spy has the codes, he must be evacuated safely.

 Objective One: Infiltrate the Comm centers and steal the codes.
 Objective Two: Evacuate the Chameleon Spy.

|The Soviets have invaded Texas! Stop them.
|Commander's Log -Texas, USA: The first Soviet unit to enter the United States was the Russian 2nd Motorized Rifle Division. They quickly set up bases in Southern Texas from which they could strike at US strategic assets all across the Southwest. American forces were quickly overwhelmed and it soon looked as though Russian and Cuban divisions would occupy all major cities in the southern US. Only a few diehard American commanders stood in the way.
|Soviet and Cuban forces are striking into Alabama. Destroy them.
|Commander's Log - Alabama, USA: In the 2nd week of the war, despite massive loses, Soviet and Cuban forces attempted to link their battle lines in Alabama. Though their resources were nearly depleted, American commanders managed to put up a stiff resistance.
|Cuban forces have invaded Florida. Push them back into the sea.
|Commander's Log - Florida, USA: While Russian forces raged across the Old South, Cuban forces quickly invaded Florida. Their first attacks were successful, however the Cubans met with grass-roots resistance when American commanders managed to procure a few MCVs from European blockade-runners.
|Soviet forces threaten Atlanta. Find and destroy their supply base.
|Commander's Log - Georgia, USA: In the 4th week of the war, Russian and Cuban forces gathered in the Georgian countryside. Their mission was simple, gather resources, replenish two badly damaged Soviet divisions and then rage into the undefended city of Atlanta. The Soviet policy was clear, resistance must be punished and the American rebels must be taught a lesson. Before the Soviets were ready, a British spy sent word of the attack to American Commanders and battle was joined.
|The Soviets have a network of bases along the Mexican border. Destroy them to end the war.
|Commander's Log - Texas, USA: As the Soviets were pushed back out of the United States, the last survivors of the battle for Texas laid siege to a mighty Russian battle fortress on the Mexican border. From this base the Soviets could make air and nuclear strikes deep into the United States. The Soviet base had to be destroyed, no matter what the price.
|Strike a blow for freedom, your forces are in Romania, destroy all Soviet forces.
|Commander's Log - Eastern Europe: While the Soviets were striking against America, the Europeans remained silent. When the Soviets nuked Chicago, the Europeans prayed the war would not come to their shores, but when the Soviets attacked Paris, even the most cautious commander knew that the time had come for war. It was a combined French and German force that struck the first blow into Eastern Europe, led by the most aggressive European commanders on the continent.
|The Soviets have counterattacked into Germany. You must hold the line.
|Commander's Log - Eastern Europe: Despite their initial success, the Allies soon found themselves surrounded on all sides by entrenched Soviet forces. Soviet units quickly cut off any chance of retreat in Romania and the Allied expeditionary force was forced to fight their way back to friendly battle lines.
|You have been ordered to seize control of the Black Sea and her harbors.
|Commander's Log - Romania: As weeks stretched into months, the Allies tired as Europe was once again a grim battleground for the most powerful nations on earth. Eager to take the battle to the enemy, the Allies sent their best commanders into the Mediterranean to seize control of vital island strongholds and prepare large fleets for an attack into the Black Sea.
|In a surprise attack, your forces have been sent into Poland. Crush the unprepared Soviets.
|Commander's Log - Poland: With the Soviets distracted by a major amphibious landing on their own shores, Allied forces seized the opportunity to make a major armored attack into Poland. In the 4th month the Allies lead their forces across the Rhine at the dead of night in the middle of winter, taking the Soviet bases completely by surprise.
|The drive into Russia has begun. Your forces are in the Ukraine and face a desperate Red Army.
|Commander's Log - Ukraine, Soviet Union: With most of Europe still weak from battle, two European commanders took it upon themselves to put an end to the war in Europe by striking against the main Soviet Headquarters inside the Russian border. Without authorization or approval from their governments, these commanders gathered what forces remained and struck what they hoped would be a final blow.
|Destroy all Soviet forces along the Sea of Japan.
|Commander's Log - Japan: The Korean government remained neutral during the first few months of the war until a Korean reporter learned that the Soviets had used Psychic Technology to mind control key members of the Korean leadership. When the story broke Korea went to war, and her commanders were to fight in almost every country in the Far East. The first attack took the Soviets almost completely by surprise as the Koreans fought along the coast of Japan for naval supremacy of the Pacific.
|Defend Vietnam from Soviet aggression.
|Commander's Log - Vietnam: As the Soviets continued to spread across South East Asia, consuming the small countries that stood in their way, the Korean Army dispatched two divisions to Vietnam to defend it against a major Soviet strike force. The Korean commanders were outnumbered almost two to one and knew that only superior leadership would save them from certain defeat.
|Your home nation, Korea is threatened, defend your lands at any cost.
|Commander's Log - Republic of Korea: Three weeks after declaring war on the Soviet Union, Korean commanders faced an invasion of their own country by a secret Soviet division hidden from their intelligence network by powerful psychic technology. Using what forces remained in country the Koreans marched to their own border and prepared to make the Soviets pay for every inch of ground.
|Invade the frozen wastes of eastern Russia and destroy the Soviet bases.
|Commander's Log - Harbin, Soviet Union: With most of the Soviet forces in the Far East neutralized or destroyed the Korean High Command ordered their generals to take the fight to the enemy and Korean forces invaded the frozen wastes of Eastern Russia.
|Complete your invasion of Siberia and destroy the Soviet supply bases that fuel war effort.
|Commander's Log - Siberia, Soviet Union: Despite massive losses to battle and the bitter cold, the Korean invasion force was not deterred and moved quickly against the oil fields of eastern Siberia. With the invasion in America going poorly for the Soviets and the European Allies attacking into Russia herself, the Koreans had a unique opportunity to deliver a crippling blow to the Soviet war machine. Korea had a chance to make a huge difference in the overall war.
|Your legions have invaded Italy. Destroy all who oppose you.
|Commander's Log - Italy: While the Russians managed to persuade a few pariah warlord states to join their cause, most were only in the war for their own gain. It was a chance for many warlord nations to prey upon their neighbors, to expand their borders and to seize the resources they needed to maintain their failing economies. While Soviet forces fought around the globe, Iraq and Libya seized the opportunity for a joint invasion of southern Italy. Only a pitiful few French and English forces opposed them.
|Greece is our next target. Destroy any Allies who dare to oppose our conquest.
|Commander's Log - Greece: As the English and French rallied their forces at the Alps the combined forces of the Iraqi and Libyan armies smashed into Greece. The Grecian army was overrun in a matter of days but a combined French and British force brought by boat from India and French Malaysia managed to put up a token resistance.
|The French and English have counterattacked in Italy. Destroy their advanced bases.
|Commander's Log - Italy: Their supply lines overextended and their armies scattered across southern Europe, the Libyans and Iraqis were vulnerable to an Allied counterattack. In the 3rd week of the war the French and English attacked, striking at the ports of southern Italy in an attempt to cut-off Iraqi forces from their naval supply lines.
|The Allies have paradropped into the fertile plane just outside Baghdad. Destroy them.
|Commander's Log - Iraq: After their failed attack, the Allies tried one last desperate gamble in the 4th week of the war. While Libyan death squads hunted down Allied troops in the Italy war-zone, the English and French took what forces they had remaining and made a massive airdrop in the fertile river basin outside of Baghdad, hoping to set up bases to siege the city.
|The French have built a massive fortress in northern Greece. This is the last point of resistance.
|Commander's Log - Greece: Assisted by French base defenses, the Allies built a massive fortress in their last remaining stronghold of northern Greece. The French and English held out for nearly three weeks before the Iraqi and Libyan armies sent in their most battle-hardened commanders to find a way to break through the Allied defenses.
|Destroy the Russian fleets and naval bases in the North Sea.
|Commander's Log - North Sea: While the Soviet army was busy crushing American resistance on the Eastern Seaboard, the Soviet Navy fought a bloody battle to cross the North Atlantic and deliver supplies and reinforcements to their troops. The first battles were fought on tiny islands in the North Sea where combined Allied forces attempted to hold back the Soviet battle groups and destroy any bases the Soviets managed to build.
|The Soviets have invaded Norway. We must save this ally from Soviet dominion.
|Commander's Log - Norway: The initial Allied success prompted an immediate and brutal response from the Soviets. Threatened by superior Allied naval forces, the Soviets invaded the neutral countries of Sweden and Norway to lay claim to the warm water ports that would allow them to build large fleets and strike anywhere along the northern coast of Europe. The Allies gathered their best commanders and with only a handful of forces, sent them into Norway to hold back the Soviet horde.
|A secret Soviet base has been discovered in the British Isles. Destroy it before it is too late.
|Commander's Log - British Isles: As the Soviets became more desperate to deliver war materials to their failing armies in America, they began to try more devious means of breaking the Allied blockade in the North Atlantic. In the 3rd month of the war, a small Soviet force made a secret landing in northern Britain and set up a base. By the time the Allies discovered the Soviet presence, it was nearly too late.
|The Soviets have swept into Germany. Stop their advance and destroy their forces.
|Commander's Log - Germany: As the war entered its 4th month the Allies grew bold and began major attacks into Poland from Austria, striking against Soviet bases and liberating thousands of Polish civilians. The Soviets responded quickly with three armored divisions that swept into eastern Germany, cutting off the Allied attackers. The battle quickly degenerated into a chaotic base versus base duel, with the outcome sure to change the course of the war in Europe.
|Victory is close at hand, destroy the Soviet naval bases in the Baltic to end the war for the North Atlantic.
|Commander's Log - Northern Baltic Sea: Victory after victory had brought the Allies into the Northern Baltic where they hoped to destroy the Soviet naval bases that continually reinforced the Soviet North Atlantic fleet. The Allies were only able to spare a few forces from their blockade groups for the assault, leaving them outnumbered three to one in what they hoped would be the final battle of the North Atlantic campaign.

|You barely succeeded in holding back the Soviet advance.
|Though we have thwarted both the plans of the Soviets and Yuri, the population of San Francisco suffered terrible losses.
|Your grinding assault cost hundreds of lives but liberated the Air Force Academy.
|Yuri has lost an important source of funds, but not without exacting a heavy price on the civilian population of Los Angeles.
|The President was rescued, though many military secrets were compromised.
|Though Yuri has been driven from Seattle, the city paid a heavy price for your victory. Much of Seattle now lies in radioactive ruins, and the software market has been thrown into disarray.
|The Psychic Amplifier was destroyed, but not before the Soviets gained valuable test data about it's effects. In spite of the tragic loss of Chicago, however, you've saved our entire nation from falling under the influence of the Soviets' most powerful psychic weapon.
|You rescued Einstein but Yuri was able to withdraw key forces before his base was destroyed.
|The missiles have been destroyed. Other Soviet missiles have been moved deep inside the USSR.
|You have destroyed Yuri's cloning facilities, but the long battle has left Sydney devastated.
|Washington DC has been saved, but at a terrible price in men and materials.
|The day is won...but at what cost? The world leaders feared for their lives during the battle and fled at first chance. The treaty holds...for now.
|Pearl Harbor has been saved, but the Hawaiian islands have been devestated by the Soviet onslaught.
|The world will never know just how close it came to complete destruction. Let's hope we got every last one of Yuri's clones.
|Saint Louis was saved, but thousands of American citizens were permanently turned to the Soviet cause.
|Thanks to you, our technology has been recovered.
|The Black Forest lab has been saved, Einstein's work can continue.
|The Chronosphere is built. Thanks to your tireless effort, the Allies are ready for one final push to victory.
|Romanov is captured, the war is won. Victory is yours.
|Thanks to you, the Pentagon has been destroyed and the American military has been thrown into chaos.
|The Psychic Dominator has been destroyed...but Yuri is now aware of our plans.
|The American fleet was destroyed. While Soviet casualties were high, this is of no concern so long as you continue to bring victory.
|Though the Chronosphere was destroyed, Einstein had enough time to flee with his research papers and keep his Chronosphere project alive.
|You have spread the power of Premier Romanov. American civilians are eagerly joining our army.
|This Psychic Dominator has been neutralized, but I doubt the Allies will ever help us again.
|In a long and bloody battle, you successfully defended mother Russia.
|Premier Romanov has been rescued and safely evacuated but he is not happy. It took too long for you to rescue him.
|You turned the Paris Tower into a weapon of terror. You have 'punished' Europe sufficiently.
|Yuri's submarines are no longer a threat, but your lengthy siege has given Yuri ample time to form another devious plan.
|The Koreans and Americans have been successfully divided. The Pacific is ours.
|Yuri's lunar base has been destroyed. Congratulations, General.
|The battle lab is safe. The Allies will not dare strike inside mother Russia again.
|Though the battle was long, you have finally rid the world of Yuri.
|Vladimir has been punished for his crimes. Your victory has not gone unnoticed in this dark hour.
|The President is ours to command. You will be rewarded for your zeal.
|The Allies cannot hold out much longer against your heavy-handed assaults. You use the lives of your men well.
|Yuri's defenses were weak and feeble. Your tank divisions swept him aside as you have swept aside so many others.
|The Allies are beaten and the world is begging to be spared the carnage of your armed forces. Supreme power is yours alone.

|Your lightning counterattack blunted the Soviet invasion.
|Your quick thinking caught both the Soviets and Yuri off guard. The Soviet invasion of San Francisco has been thwarted, and Yuri's plans have been thrown into disarray. Well done, Commander.
|Your tank blitz stunned the Soviets, ending the battle in a few short hours.
|Great job, Commander. Your quick actions minimized civilian losses in the city and denied Yuri an important source of income to fund his plans. Hollywood agents are already offering deals for the rights to your life story.
|The President was rescued long before the Soviets could discover any important military secrets.
|Yuri's plot to blackmail the city of Seattle has been thwarted. Your lightning-fast response prevented heavy losses to the population. Yuri will have to look elsewhere to fund his war effort.
|The tragic loss of Chicago, however devastating, doesn't compare to the loss of our whole nation. Your quick destruction of the Psychic Amplifier meant that the Soviets never had time to fully test its power.
|With your speed and accuracy Einstein was rescued and Yuri's installation is no more. Yuri realizes now you're a force to be reckoned with.
|Soviet commanders are still analyzing your attack, trying to discover the secrets of your advanced covert strategies.
|Yuri's cloning facilities are now rubble thanks to your incredible tactics. Well done!
|The precision with which you destroyed the Soviet forces and liberated Washington DC is one for the record books.
|Yuri never had a chance. The world leaders are safe and Yuri has been driven from London. Excellent work, General.
|You defended Pearl Harbor with such ferocity that the Pacific is ours.
|The whole world now knows your true brilliance as a commander. Your image is appearing on stamps in every nation across the globe, and a worldwide holiday has been declared in your honor.
|You saved Saint Louis before her citizens could come to any harm.
|Soviet Soldiers have nicknamed you "The Ghost" for your skills at stealthy destruction.
|Impressed by your efficiency, German Commanders have asked you to train their officers in strategy and command.
|Russian commanders fear your command more than whole Allied divisions. If one man can make a difference, you are that man.
|Your legendary command skills will go down in history. You are one of the greatest generals of all time.
|The Pentagon was crushed so quickly that many important American generals were captured by our victorious soldiers, crippling their armed forces.
|You have destroyed the Psychic Dominator before Yuri could react. Yuri does not yet realize our plans.
|The American fleet and Naval base were destroyed so quickly that your soldiers were able to capture several American officers.
|Your ferocious assault on Einstein's Lab and the swift destruction of the Chronosphere have ensured that the Soviet people shall be victorious in the war. The Allies are already retreating on all fronts.
|The Psychic Beacon was built so quickly that an entire American Armored division was captured by its power before they could escape.
|The Psychic Dominator has been destroyed and the Allies believe we fought for a common good. Fools.
|The Korean invasion was repelled with such ferocity that some members of their government have spoken secretly to us of peace.
|Premier Romanov has been rescued and safely evacuated thanks to your quick and decisive elimination of Yuri's base.
|The French fear your command more than they fear our tanks. In Paris you are known only as 'The Butcher'.

Emergency transmissions from GDI forces in this region indicate that Phoenix Base is under attack from Nod troops. It is imperative that the base be restored by building a Tiberium Refinery and a Barracks. Once the base is functional, all Nod forces in the area must be destroyed.

 Objective One: Build a Tiberium Refinery.
 Objective Two: Build a Barracks.
 Objective Three: Destroy all Nod forces.
|
The Kodiak was lost en route to the Philadelphia. We believe it has crashed somewhere in the area. The Kodiak was carrying the recently recovered Tacitus when it went down. Take a small team and locate the crash site and determine if the Kodiak can be repaired. Recover the Tacitus at all costs. Be advised, there are reports that NOD forces and hostile Tiberian life forms have been sighted in the area. The ion storm is still in full force, so advanced units cannot be used.

END TRANSMISSION.

First Objective: Find the Kodiak and determine if it can be salvaged.
Second Objective: Recover the Tacitus and return it to the pickup zone.
|
The Nod forces that attacked Phoenix Base have been traced back to a small base in this sector. Orders received from GDI Command state that the Nod base must be destroyed. However, there is a significant civilian population in the immediate area that must be evacuated by ORCA Transport before the fighting gets too heavy. Before the Transports can safely land, all seven SAM sites must be destroyed. Once the civilians have been evacuated, the Nod base can be destroyed.

 Objective One: Deploy the M.C.V. and begin building a base.
 Objective Two: Destroy all Nod SAM sites.
 Objective Three: Destroy the Nod base.
|
We have lost communication with a small civilian settlement nearby. Incoming messages from our remote base indicate an attack from unidentified life forms. Investigate these sightings and protect the civilians at all costs. Escort as many civilians as possible to the pickup zone for immediate evacuation.

END TRANSMISSION.

First Objective: Protect the small clusters of civilians and escort them to the designated airlift zone.
Second Objective: Defend the base from attacks until reinforcements arrive.
|
GDI forces in this sector have found something unusual and large that crashed nearby. Nod has taken an intense interest in whatever it is, so naturally we are interested as well. Locate the object from the reports and capture any Nod Technology Centers in the area that might have uncovered clues as to the identity of the object.

 Objective One: Locate the Crash Site.
 Objective Two: Capture any Nod Technology Centers.
|
Nod has positioned a supply base in the area near a civilian train station. We can use the train and supplies to infiltrate the larger Nod base to the east. Avoiding patrols where possible and destroy all the Nod structures in the area. Once the area is secure, capture the train station for our use. DO NOT destroy the station or the train, as they are vital to our plans. Engineers and other reinforcements are available, but not unlimited - do not waste them.

 Objective One: Destroy all Nod structures.
 Objective Two: Capture the train station.
|
The death of Tratos has caused open revolt among the mutant population. They believe the local food and water supplies have been poisoned and are attacking the local supply depot. This has aggravated civilian tensions in the area causing armed conflict between the two factions.

Deploy your squad and quell the rioting. Prevent casualties and damage on BOTH sides of the conflict. To this end we have equipped your infantry with non-lethal weaponry. In addition, you must prevent the destruction of the depot as it supplies all of the relocated civilians and mutants in the area.

END TRANSMISSION.

First Objective: Neutralize the four riot leaders without killing any of the civilians or mutants.
Second Objective: Prevent the Supply Depot from being destroyed.
|
Whatever is contained in this craft, it is apparent that Nod doesn't want GDI to have it. Protect the crashed UFO until GDI reinforcements can arrive to fortify the area.

 Objective One: Survive until reinforcements can arrive.
 Objective Two: Prevent Nod from destroying the UFO.
|
CABALs core is believed to be in this area. Using an engineer, infiltrate and capture the core. Cut off enemy reinforcements by destroying the two bridges that supply this base. Nod is utilizing self-powered laser fencing to protect the core from intruders. Disable this fencing by capturing the appropriate command stations using local civilian technicians. Once inside, neutralize any remaining defense systems guarding the core.

END TRANSMISSION.

First Objective: Destroy the two bridges to stem the flow of reinforcements.
Second Objective: Infiltrate and capture CABAL's core.
|
Destroy the three relay stations and the radar array to blackout Nod's sensor net. This will make rescuing Tratos easier, as Nod will not be as quick to detect you.

Objective One: Destroy the three relay stations.
Objective Two: Destroy the radar array.
|
Nod is experimenting on mutant survivors at a facility in this sector. Among them is Tratos, leader of the mutants.

The second piece of the Tacitus is rumored to be held inside an ancient temple outside of La Paz, Bolivia. Ghoststalker and one of our archaeologists will assist you in locating the temple and retrieving the Tacitus.

We also have a new unit for you to test: it's called the Juggernaut and is our new long-range artillery unit. Be advised: this area is completely uncharted.

END TRANSMISSION.

First Objective: Reconnoiter the area and identify the Temple of the Tacitus.
Second Objective: Recover the Tacitus from the temple and proceed to the designated airlift zone.
|
The hydroelectric dams in this area provide Vega's island fortress with almost limitless power. Destroying the dams will seriously cripple Vega's perimeter defenses and allow GDI to bring more weapons to bear against Vega's base.

The dams are heavily fortified, so attacking them directly is not the best option. Surveillance indicates the key to destroying the dams lies in the destruction of two regulator stations. Without them, the dams' generators will overload and the dams will self destruct.

Objective One: Destroy the dams any way possible.
|
Vega's base of operations is in the area. It is heavily guarded by SAM sites, and a secondary outpost provides reinforcements. Destroy all Nod forces in the area, but capture Vega's Pyramid intact - there is information there that we can use. You will have only limited troops until the SAM sites are neutralized one way or another.

Objective One: Destroy the Nod base.
Objective Two: Capture Vega's Pyramid.
|
CABAL has betrayed us all. GDI and perhaps the Earth itself are doomed unless we can fall back and regroup in time to send for help. The first priority is to deliver Dr. Boudreau to the nearby GDI outpost for immediate evacuation. Once safe, she will call for additional reinforcements.

END TRANSMISSION.

First Objective: Escort Dr. Boudreau to the GDI outpost for immediate evacuation.
Second Objective: Fortify this outpost and destroy CABALs base.
|
Hammerfest base has been overrun by Nod troops. The Firestorm walls block direct approach, so another route must be found back into the complex. Using hover MLRS and waterways for access, find a way back to the GDI base and re-capture it. Once the base is back in GDI hands, destroy all Nod forces in the area.

Objective One: Find a way back to the GDI base.
Objective Two: Re-capture the base with engineers.
Objective Three: Destroy all Nod forces in the area.
|
We have lost communication with our base outside of Trondheim. Scout the area and determine the cause of this interruption. We have no tactical data on CABAL's forces in that area and we need information.

END TRANSMISSION.

First Objective: Warn the local civilians of the CABAL threat.
Second Objective: Establish a base and destroy CABALs forces.
|
It is imperative that you prevent the train carrying the crystals from reaching the Nod base. Recent ice melts in the region have washed out the only train bridge. However, Nod engineers are on their way to repair it, so you must move quickly. If you can get to the train before the bridge is repaired, we can recover the crystals with little trouble. Otherwise, we will have to assault the Nod base to reclaim the crystals. Remember, to stop the train, you must destroy the locomotive, not the cars, but the cargo car holds the crystals.

Objective One: Locate the train and destroy the locomotive before Nod engineers repair the bridge. The cargo car holds the crystals.
Objective Two: If the bridge is repaired and the train successfully reaches the Nod base, then you must locate and destroy this base to recover the crystals.
|
GDI scientists have reprogrammed a Nod cyborg and have implanted a virus designed for release into CABAL's communications network. The cyborg must be inserted into CABAL's defensive outpost for the virus to take effect. CABAL is aware of this operation and will do anything to prevent it. Establish your base quickly before CABAL can fortify his position.

END TRANSMISSION.

First Objective: Insert the infected cyborg into the defensive outpost's network center.
Second Objective: Destroy the cyborg manufacturing facility.
Third Objective: Destroy all remaining CABAL forces.
|
Umagon has requested help to rescue her people from a Nod prison. The prison is located on an island to the east. Nod has a strong force in the area, both in outposts and spread throughout the nearby city. We have limited resources and no reinforcements are available, so avoiding patrols is vital to your success. Umagon has a team in the area already - if you can find them, they may assist you. Make your way to the prison and release the hostages. Once the prison is secure, we will send a transport to evacuate Umagon's people. There may be SAM sites nearby, so make sure the way is clear for the transport.

Objective One: Locate the Nod prison.
Objective Two: Release and evacuate the prisoners.
|
This chemical supply station is providing vast quantities of Tiberium toxins to a number of Nod research programs in the area. Destroying this site will seriously hinder further Nod research and prevent this base from transporting reinforcements to others in the sector.

Intelligence reports advise caution when near any of the chemical tanks and facilities, as the toxins contained within are highly corrosive and equally deadly to soldiers and vehicles.

Objective One Find a suitable location for a base.
Objective Two: Destroy the Nod Chemical station.
Special Objective: Get Ghost Stalker onto the train. Ghost must not die!
|
If the upcoming GDI attack on the missile sites is to succeed. C4 must be planted at all six power stations.

If Nod forces discover the demolition team and sound the alert, take out the power plants by any means available.

Objective One: Plant C4 at the power plants.
|
Nod's main chemical missile plant is located in this area. It is responsible for the large amount of Tiberium poisoning and accelerated mutations of wildlife in the surrounding areas. Destroying this facility will prevent Nod from furthering the acceleration of Tiberium poisoning on the planet.

Objective One: Destroy Nod's missile silos.
Objective Two: Destroy all Nod forces.
|
We've tracked down CABAL and are ready to engage his forces on all fronts. This is an all-out assault. Nod forces have reluctantly agreed to a temporary cease-fire and are launching their own simultaneous offensive against CABAL. Destruction of the core is essential to our victory.

END TRANSMISSION.

First Objective: Build a base and repel initial attacks.
Second Objective: Capture the 3 control stations to shut down the laser fences and firestorm defense system protecting CABAL.
Third Objective: Destroy CABALs Core.
|
One of two possible locations of the prototype manufacturing facility. Use the mutants to locate the position of the production facility. The mutants must remain undetected. If Nod suspects enemy forces in the area, they will cloak the facility and deploy troops to destroy them. If the mutants can hide from the Nod troops for a short period, the base will assume the area is clear and uncloak. Once we record the location of the base. GDI Dropships will arrive with reinforcements.

Objective One: Using mutants you must locate the Prototype Manufacturing Facility.
Objective Two: Once the facility is located reinforcements will be sent in to help construct a base. You are to destroy the Manufacturing Facility at this time.
|
Another possible location of the Prototype Manufacturing Facility. Use the mutants to locate the position of the production facility. The mutants must remain undetected. If Nod suspects enemy forces in the area, they will cloak the facility and deploy troops to destroy them.

 Objective One: Locate and free the Rebel Nod Commander.
|
While GDI forces have been diverted to defend civilians, you are to lead an elite strike force to assassinate the mutant leader Tratos. Our new limpet mines will help you locate Tratos within his fortified base. Once located you must devise a way to reach him. GDI will have considerable protection for Tratos as he is their last hope at countering the Tiberium onslaught. Destroying their power supply should neutralize the firestorm defense system, and an effective air strike should deal with the sensor arrays.

Do not fail: this mission is integral to the future of the Brotherhood of Nod.

DATA LINK CLOSED.

First Objective: Attach limpet mines to GDI units to penetrate the base and locate Tratos.
Second Objective: Deactivate the firestorm defense system and neutralize the sensor arrays.
Third Objective: Assassinate Tratos.
|
GDI has secured the Holy Ground the temple rests on. Your objective is simple, locate it and remove the GDI incursion. They are not expecting any Nod forces, so the element of surprise is yours. The temple and its knowledge must remain intact. One vision, One purpose!

 Object One: Locate the Temple of Nod.
 Objective Two: Destroy all GDI forces.
|
Taking out this weak position of GDI forces will allow us to reclaim our Sarajevo temple without interruption. Move in under the cover of an ion storm - while GDI's communications will be down. Take out the Radar Facility before the storm abates.

 Objective One: Locate and destroy the GDI Radar Facility before the ion storm ends.
|
The mutant vermin have once again made themselves known to us. They have stolen the Tacitus that I...we have worked so hard to obtain. If Kane's vision is to be fulfilled, we must find the mutant encampment and recover the Tacitus. Once it is safely removed, terminate any mutants who decide to remain in the area. Perhaps this will teach them not to interfere with us ever again.

DATA LINK CLOSED.

First Objective: Locate the mutant encampment.
Second Objective: Recover the Tacitus and return it to the drop zone.
Third Objective: Destroy all remaining mutant forces.
|
The alien craft is located in this region. FIND IT! The area is infested with GDI, so stealth would be to your advantage. Once the craft is located get an engineer inside to retrieve the Tacitus. And, should you encounter Vega's forces - consider them expendable.

 Objective One: Locate the crashed UFO and retrieve Kane's artifacts.
 Objective Two: Stop the transport of the Tacitus at all costs.
|
CABAL has betrayed us all. We must escape and regroup in order to repay him for his treachery. There is an abandoned airfield nearby; if we can reach it, we have a chance. Once there, we must repair the array to contact our forces and call for an immediate evacuation. We have no information or tactical support now that CABAL has gone rogue.

DATA LINK CLOSED.

First Objective: Evade CABAL's forces and find the abandoned airfield.
Second Objective: Repair the array to call for an immediate evacuation.
Third Objective: Retreat to the Montauk.
|
Control of the mutants is in our grasp. Their headquarters is located to the north of your drop-off position.

Allow the blame to fall squarely upon Solomon's shoulders.

 Objective One: Capture the enemy Construction Yard awaiting you.

 Objective Two: Use GDI units to destroy the mutant's base.
|
You must reach the medical colony in the region without being prematurely detected by GDI and forcing a base evacuation. To prevent this, consider first destroying the three sensor towers protecting the base. Our new artillery unit should be sufficient for the job. Once inside the base, the capture of the mutant female should be easy.

 Objective One: Find and destroy the GDI sensor towers without getting too close and getting detected by them.

 Objective Two: Once the towers are destroyed, move on the base and capture the medical colony before Umagon, the Mutant, can escape.
|
The mutant female may be trying to reach the underground railway system located in New Detroit. Move in and control the station before she arrives. If she boards the train then it must be stopped. This may be our last chance at capturing the abomination.

 Objective One: Locate the train station in the area and capture it before Umagon flies in and boards the train to escape into the underground.

 Objective Two: If Umagon boards the train before you have captured the station then you must stop the train before it leaves the region. Destroy the locomotive and we will be able to capture Umagon.
|
Since CABAL has turned on us we are suffering a communications blackout. We are forced to try and obtain GDI's EVA technology. There is a small GDI airbase in this sector.

After she has been freed, commandeer a GDI transport to make your escape.

 Objective One: Locate and free Oxanna.
 Objective Two: Steal a GDI transport to make an escape.
|
Prior to our main assault on CABAL, we need to slow down his production capabilities. CABAL is harvesting Tiberium heavily in Eastern Africa. Proceed there and eliminate CABAL's harvesting facilities. Our forces are scattered at this time and we can only afford to provide you with a small strike force.

Use the new Fist of Nod mobile production facility to build up an effective strike force and crush them.

DATA LINK CLOSED.

First Objective: Save the Civilians and their town from CABAL's siege.
Second Objective: Disrupt and prevent CABAL's Tiberium harvesting.
|
The Nod base in this sector has been overrun by Tiberium life forms. Weedeaters have proven to be effective against the Tiberium creatures, but we must move reinforcements in quickly before the base is completely destroyed. Once the situation has been stabilized, the GDI base in the area must be eliminated.

 Objective One: Locate and secure the old base.
 Objective Two: Destroy the GDI base.
|
The road through this sector is a vital supply link. If a foothold is firmly established and a Tiberium Waste Facility is built, Nod chemical missiles can be launched from the region. The GDI base in the area has no defense against the missiles, and can be destroyed at your leisure once the waste convoys start arriving.

 Objective One: Establish a base and build a Tiberium Waste Facility.
 Objective Two: Destroy the GDI base.
|
This is it Commander! Take out CABAL fast and hard: No mercy and no surrender. Find a way to get inside his defenses and take out the core. GDI forces are distracting CABAL and now is the perfect time to crush CABAL once and for all.

DATA LINK CLOSED.

First Objective: Build your base and survive the initial onslaught from CABAL.
Second Objective: Capture the 3 control stations to shut down the laser fences and firestorm defense system protecting CABAL.
Third Objective: Destroy CABALs core.
|
GDI is set to test the prototype of their new weapon, the Mammoth Mark II. It is vital that we sabotage their production of this monster as soon as possible. Before we can do that however, we need to know where the test is being held. Send a Chameleon Spy into one of the Radar Facilities. The coordinates to the testing ground should be stored there. Be careful of the patrols in the area - we have only one spy available. Once we have the location of the test, construct a base and destroy the prototype. You now have access to the new Banshee aircraft, which should prove useful. Destroying the remainder of the GDI base is at your discretion, but the Mammoth MUST be destroyed.

 Objective One: Spy on one of the GDI Comm Centers.
 Objective Two: Destroy the Mammoth Mark II prototype.
|
Jake McNeil, brother of one of GDI's commanders, will be leading an inspection tour to a small GDI outpost in this area. His knowledge of GDI activities could be of great benefit to Nod's cause. Capture the GDI outpost with engineers, then disguise the base as GDI's and wait for Jake to make his inspection. When the signal is given, use the Toxin soldiers provided to "persuade" Jake to join Nod's forces. Once he is under our influence, EVAC him at the designated site.

Be very careful not to alert GDI until we are ready to strike. If they detect Nod forces in the area, they will surely try to evacuate Jake. If GDI is alerted, be sure to get to Jake before he can leave the area.

 Objective One: Capture the GDI outpost.
 Objective Two: Capture Jake.
 Objective Three: EVAC Jake at the specified location.
|
In order for our ICBMs to shoot down the Philadelphia, they must be able to triangulate the station's position. Our spies have placed beacons at the optimal deployment locations. Once the launchers have been moved to the beacons, the station's fate is sealed and the Temple of Nod may be built. Move with all due haste. If the Philadelphia is able to complete three orbits, it will lock onto our position and destroy Kane's plans.

 Objective One: Deploy ICBM launchers at the three beacons.
|
GDI has stored the firing codes for its Ion Cannon in three separate Comm centers. The centers are isolated in a valley and poorly guarded. We do not have the forces available for a full-scale assault. However, a small infiltration team led by the Chameleon Spy has a reasonable chance of success. Once the Spy has the codes, he must be evacuated safely.

 Objective One: Infiltrate the Comm centers and steal the codes.
 Objective Two: Evacuate the Chameleon Spy.

- Texas DMZ - 
 It's Americans versus Soviets in the Southwestern United States. Players must push the Soviets and their Cuban allies out of the Texas plains. The campaign ends with the destruction of a Russian fortress just inside the Mexican border. Difficulty is EASY.
|Soviet bases in Cuba pose a threat to the Continental United States so they must be eliminated. Commander 1 will take control of our secret Air Force Command near the coast. Commander 2 will secure the city of Havana.
|Yuri has managed to establish bases in the Hollywood Hills. Commander 1 will take charge of the area around LAX. Commander 2 will take command of the power and oil facilities just east of the freeway.
|You have successfully driven Yuri and his Russian allies back into the USSR. The time has come to finish them, Commanders. Establish your bases and end this war.
|
- European Theater - 
 Knock on the Soviet's front door in Eastern Europe. Players choose between British, French and German Allies. The battle ends with an attack across the Russian border at a major Soviet outpost. Difficulty is EASY.
|The Americans believe they can hold Seattle. Crush thier defensive positions and let us move on to more glorious battles. Commander 1 will take command of our naval forces, while Commander 2 prepares for a crushing armored assault.
|The traitor Yuri is rebuilding his forces in the Egyptian desert. Commander 1 will take charge of our old base along the Nile. Commander 2 must protect our oil fields just south of Yuri's front lines.
|It appears the Black Forest of Germany will be the final resting place of both our enemies. Both seek out Einstein's laboratory in vain hope it will give them hope of survival. Intelligence has pin pointed the location of the nuclear reactors that must surely power Einstein's lab. Secure your positions and then seek out and destroy the enemies of the Soviet state once and for all.
|
- Guardians of the East - 
 The Republic of Korea must thwart Soviet aggression in South East Asia. The campaign culminates with the Korean forces invading the snowy shoreline of eastern Russia. Difficulty is MODERATE.
|The Allies have constructed defenses around their precious White House. They hide behind their technology like scared children. Establish your bases and end their poor mindless attempts to hold us back.
|The Red Army has managed to steal the Allies prism technology and is trying to develop their own version of the Prism Tower at a secret research facility deep in the Yucatan jungle. We will launch a surprise attack on their base and squash the Soviets last hope for victory. Commander 1 will begin north of a small oil field. Commander two will begin just east of a local airport.
|The Allies and Soviets have allied against us. They have gathered the last of their forces in London. Commander 1 will control our oil derrick in the city and Commander 2 will control the hospital across the Thames. This victory will ensure Yuri's mastery of the world.
|
- African Warlords - 
 Seize the oil fields of North Africa. Players control Iraqi and Libyan factions, fighting European Allies. Difficulty is MODERATE.
|In the wake of the Soviet invasion, Yuri has established two bases in the heart of New York City. No longer under Yuri's control, the Red Army has allied with the Americans to defeat the traitor.
|
- Red Storm - 
 Players choose among the American and European Allies to fight the Russians in the North Sea and across Northern Europe. The campaign ends with a spectacular naval battle in the cold Baltic sea. Difficulty is HARD.

- Recreate the original Tiberian Sun feeling for the TS gamers playing on the official Tiberian Sun/Firestorm maps... with true TS terrain.

|Like our own Construction Vehicle, the Soviets can use this MCV to place base anywhere.
|The Soviet War Miner can easily hold off a small attack force. When hunting down the War Miner, send plenty of fire-power.
|Simple Soviet technology. The Rhino Heavy Tank is slow, heavily armored and fitted with a devestating short range cannon.
|The Soviet Terror Drone can easily penetrate the armor of our vehicles. Once inside a vehicle the Terror Drone will destroy it slowly from within. The only way to get a Terror Drone out of a vehicle is to move it to a Service Depot.
|The Flak Track is standard Soviet air defense. Like all Soviet technology, it is slow and well armored.
|The V3 is a powerful long-range artillery weapon. Beware commander, it can level your base in minutes without you ever getting a chance to even return fire.
|The most powerful Soviet Tank ever built, the Apocalpyse is a small army all by itself and is equipped to handle both ground and air threats.
|The most powerful air unit ever created, the Kirov can take a beating and drop an almost unlimitted number of heavy iron bombs.
|The Sea Scorpion makes an excellent raider and can also be used to escort heavy Soviet warships.
|The Soviets have somehow managed to pacify and control the Giant Squid found in the cold waters of the North Pacific. Beware commander, they can immobilize a ship and pull it under in a matter of minutes.
|The Soviets use their Typhoon Attack Sub to raid our shipping and make surprise attacks on our fleets.
|The Armored Transort is meant to carry a large number of troops across an ocean to our shores. It is often filled with Soviet troops and can be difficult to destroy.
|The ultimate in Soviet long-range bombardment, the Dreadnought is powerful from a distance but can be easily destroyed at close range. The Dreadnought's missiles can also be shot down by patriot missiles.
|The standard Soviet grunt, the Consript is poorly fed, poorly trained and poorly equipped for combat with your boys.
|The Soviets have taken Tesla Technology to the final step, a man in a Tesla powered suit. These soldiers are excellent at destroying tanks and also seem to be able to power up Tesla Coils with their extra energy.
|The Soviet Engineer is effective though he is more poorly trained than his American counter-part.
|Beware these Soviet Attack Dogs, they can quickly sniff out our spies and ruin all of our attempts at covert operations.
|This Soviet lunatic can and will place bombs on just about anything.
|This soldier is equiped with a nuclear battlesuit. He can irradiate large patches of ground, making them impassible to infantry or light vehicles.
|The Soviets have been experimenting with Psychic technology with some success. Their elite PsiCorps can cause our own loyal soldiers to turn against us.
|Sir, our GI is the finest example of standard infantry soldier in the world. Whether deployed or garrisoning a city building, the GI's heavy machine gun can quickly neutralize any enemy infantry threat.
|This, sir, is our IFV. It is a multipurpose raider capable of boosting the standard weapon capabilities of any infantryman inside.
|Sir, this is an engineer. He can repair any Allied building and once inside an enemy building turn it to our side. He is much smarter than his Soviet counterpart.
|Sir, the SEAL is the elite soldier. No enemy is safe from him, whether on land or water.
|Commander, the spy's ability to mask himself as the enemy and pass through their ranks gives him the needed edge to infiltrate even the most well guarded enemy building. If only they didn't taste so good to their dogs_
|The Rocketeers are the brave men who strap maneuvering thrusters to their backs and then go out to hunt enemy tanks and air forces. They are very brave.
|Commander, this is a Chrono Legionnaire. Using Professor Einstein's Chronal technology they teleport next to any enemy and utterly erase them from time.
|Sir, these superbly trained dolphins are equipped with special array that allows them to concentrate their natural sonar to easily locate enemy submerged vessels or further concentrate their sonar to attack.
|Although not as well armored as its Soviet counterpart, our Grizzly Battle tank is much faster and packs the same punch.
|Commander, our Prism Tank is based on the Prof. Einstein's light enhancement process. It is most effective in dealing with the massive force tactics that the Soviets prefer to use.
|Commander, our Mirage Tank's ability to hide itself among any natural objects around it make it the perfect ambush or covert surveillance vehicle.
|The Black Hawk helicopter utilizes the most advanced stealth technologies slip past enemy lines without detection on radar.
|Sir, the Intruder is a VTOL attack aircraft capable of delivery its ordinance on any target package you desire across the combat zone.
|Another marvel of technology from Professor Einstein's bag of tricks. Our Chrono Miners can teleport safely and quickly straight back home after gathering their ore supply.
|Commander, our landing craft is capable of quickly ferrying troops and armor across any body of water- wherever you need them- whenever you need them.
|Commander, our Destroyer is the workhorse of the navy. No naval unit can long hide from it and once detected, it makes short work of the enemy.
|Commander, there is no airborne threat that can evade the sight or missile of the Aegis Cruiser. It is the premier anti-air weapon.
|Sir, our Aircraft Carriers are the pride of the Allied navy. In a moments notice, the carrier's planes can take out any target quickly and from a very safe distance.

|The Soviet Construction Vehicle is essential and should be defended as such. You cannot create a Construction Yard without one.
|The Allied Chrono Miner may have the greater speed of teleportation but our War Miner is heavily armored and heavily armed making it immune to most harassment attacks.
|As the backbone of the Soviet assault force, the Rhino Heavy Tank should be used in all forward positions.
|Soviet technology at its finest. Terror Drones can enter and destroy enemy vehicles from the inside.
|The Flak Track is an effective anti-air defense unit, but its flak burst just as effective against ground targets if you don't mind the mess.
|The V3 Launcher has extreme range capabilities coupled with devastating damage potential. Destruction guaranteed just don't leave it undefended.
|The appropriately named Apocalypse Tank is war in a can. It can attack any ground or air targets and be expected to be the last unit standing.
|They may be slow, but the Kirov Airships can take great punishment and deliver even more.
|The Sea Scorpion is a fast-attack sea raider. It can't win the war for you but you can't win the war without it. It is your only anti-air defense on the water.
|I don't agree with this kind of experimentation, but you cannot deny the results. A Giant Squid can immobilize and eventually destroy any sea vessel.
|The Typhoon Attack Sub is undetectable by normal Allied units, but look out for Allied Dolphins and Destroyers.
|Unlike the Allied naval transport, our Armored Transport is well armed. It will get your men and units to the target.
|The Soviet Dreadnought can launch destructive missiles over great distances, but its fire rate is too slow for direct combat.
|Our Soviet Conscripts may not be as well trained as the Allied GI, but we have the advantage of greater numbers.
|The Tesla Troopers have powerful weapons, but they are useless against buildings. They also make excellent base defense as they can over-power Tesla Coils with their weapons.
|The Soviet Engineer can repair buildings or capture enemy buildings, if you can get them past defenses.
|Soviet attack dogs can smell out enemy Spies and deal with them quickly. Don't leave them out of your base defense teams.
|Crazy Ivan can plant bombs on enemy buildings or perhaps a Conscript would agree to carry them for you.
|The Allies cannot match our nuclear power. Deploy the Desolator to sterilize an area.
|Our most top-secret weapon, the PsiCorps is useful for quickly turning Allied units to our side.
|Commander, this Allied GI is a well trained soldier capable of quickly deploying a heavy machine gun when stationed within buildings or deployed with his sandbag nest.
|This_thing_is the allied IFV. Any soldier that climbs inside will find his primary weapon's capabilities boosted. As with most Allied vehicles it is very quick.
|Although similar to our own engineers in their ability to repair damaged buildings and bridges or even to steal another's building, the Allied engineers are nowhere near as well trained as our own engineers.
|Comrade, this SEAL is a threat to all of our forces. They must be watched for at all times, whether on land or even at sea.
|These arrogant Allied Spies believe their disguises will allow them to infiltrate our buildings. They will soon find that the only thing they can infiltrate is our faithful dogs' stomachs.
|The Allied Rocketeers are men who hurl themselves through the air thanks to some jet-pack strapped to them in the hopes of wounding one of our tanks or buildings. Fools.
|Commander, beware these Chrono Legionnaires. They use some unknown technology to teleport themselves anywhere and then simply erase our forces.
|These dolphin nuisances are quick. They can sense the passage of our submarines and find our Squids and their squeal can do some damage as well.
|Commander, the Allied Grizzly Tank is a smaller, quicker version of our own tanks, but its armor is not sufficient to stand up directly to our own.
|Comrade, this `Prism' Tank of the Allies is a dangerous threat to our massed forces. Its directed energy weapon has no trouble harming many of our forces in a single shot.
|Another annoying trick of the Allies, their Mirage Tank can mask itself a nearly any object nearby it and then remain concealed and fire upon us.
|Sir, the enemy's Black Hawk transport must always be watched for. It can not be seen by radar, so you must keep a watchful eye ready to stop it.
|The Allied Intruder is an airborne threat to any of our forces who do not have adequate anti-air support. It does not stand up well to flak, Commander.
|Yet another parlor trick from that nuisance Einstein. The Allied Chrono Miner gathers ore from the field and then teleports itself and its small yield back to its refinery.
|Compared to our own Armored Transport, this small transport is unimpressive. It delivers a small number of forces across the water.
|These Allied Destroyers are a problem. They can detect us underwater as well as on the surface and are equipped to deal sufficient damage to both.
|Commander, this is the Allies Aegis Cruiser. If you do not try to attack it from the air, then it will quickly be underwater and harmless.
|Commander, these Allied Aircraft Carriers are dangerous if left alone to bomb us from a distance but they are not very good for close combat against submerged combatants.
|Comrade, Tanya is a threat to all of our forces. They must be watched for at all times, whether on land or even at sea.
|If you say so
|Do I have to?
|Is this a REAL gun?
|Will I get hurt?

|Tesla suit ready!
|Extra crispy.
|Charging up.
|Electrodes ready!
|Checking connection.
|He belongs to us.
|His mind is weak.
|There is no resistance.
|A new comrade joins us.
|Look deeply into my eyes_
|<death sounds>
|<death sounds>
|<death sounds>
|Yes, of course.
|Predictable.
|Thoughts received.
|My command is your wish.
|Psychic ready.
|Tell me your wish.
|I know your thoughts.
|Your mind is clear.
|The mind is quicker than the eye.
|Don't forget, Sir! Order Tanya as you see fit, but we CANNOT afford to lose her. You must reach Fort Bradley before it is destroyed.
|Looks like the bridge has been blown. We'll have to find another way to Fort Bradley.
|The Soviet Navy is attacking the Statue of Liberty! We can't let them get away with that! Sir, is there anything you can do?
|Doesn't sound good, Sir! We're going to have to double-time it the rest the way to reach Fort Bradley in time!
|Congratulations! We've reestablished contact with Fort Bradley! They're turning over control of the base and its troops to you.
|We seem to have lost power, sir! Build more power plants.
|Looks like the bridge has collapsed. We'll have to get our Engineers to repair it!
|Watch out for those Petroleum barrels - They seem highly unstable! Perhaps we can use them to our advantage...
|Our GI's are too exposed to enemy fire! Maybe they should take shelter in nearby buildings!
|Sir, I'm sorry to report that we've lost Tanya_
|There's the Supply Base! Destroy all of the buildings, and we'll buy some time for the rest of the country!
|We've done it Sir! The Supply Base has been eliminated!
|You must hurry to reach Fort Bradley as quickly as possible!
|To earn more credits, command your Chrono Miners to gather ore.
|This vehicle is known as a Chrono Miner - it can be used to gather valuable minerals, and when fully loaded will teleport back to the Refinery docking bay.
|Additional Soviet forces are incoming, and will surely arrive soon!
|Soviet paratroopers detected.
|Commander, you must reach Fort Bradley as quick... wait... What are those Dreadnoughts doing? They're attacking the Statue of Liberty? You can't let this happen!
|Liberty is fallen, sir. This looks like the beginning of the end.
|Tanya has perished, sir. We can't do this without her!
|Sir, Fort Bradley just reported that the Soviets have managed to establish a small supply base just southeast of here. If we can eliminate the supply base, perhaps can stall the invasion for a short while!
|Deploy an occupied civilian structure to evacuate its occupants.
|All right! This beacon's neutralized! Send in the cavalry
|You have discovered Allied units abandoned after the Soviet invasion.
|The Psychic Beacon must be destroyed, Commander!
|Watch out for Soviet troops garrisoned in civilian structures throughout the city!
|Objective 1: Use your paradrop squad to take out the Soviet Tesla Reactors, shutting down their harbor defenses.
|Objective 2:
|Seek out the Soviets' Tesla Reactors and take them out with your Destroyers, crippling their air defenses.
|Perhaps we should send our Destroyers scouting up the Chicago River, they may reveal key installations in the Soviet base.
|You can check one missile off your list, Sir! That bird will never fly again.
|Sir, we managed to capture one of the Silos - instead of destroying it! Why don't we just turn it against the other missile Silo?
|If you can get a Spy into one of those Tesla Generators, he can probably shut down all of the base's power for a good 30 seconds.
|I'm resizing your radar to compensate for the Nuclear missile coordinates that we just received. Stand by.
|Sir! You just blew up the Soviet Battlelab! Without the Missile Silo coordinates, we can't complete our mission!
|Congratulations, Sir! With both nukes neutralized, the European Alliance can join the war! We may have just changed the course of history!
|If you can get a Spy into one of those Tesla Generators, he can probably shut down all of the base's power for a good 60 seconds.
|Sir, Tanya is missing in action. Without her, our efforts here are in vain.
|Thanks for rescuing us, Sir! Our plane was shot down by Soviet anti-aircraft. There's probably more survivors around here.
|Glad you found us, Sir! We're freezing out here!
|Good to see you, Sir! What are our orders?
|Be on the lookout for spies, Comrade. It seems a little quiet tonight.
|(Laugh) We don't need to worry about stupid American spies. That's what the dogs are for.
|Looks like we're going to need some more Spies, Sir!
|Sir, could you send some more Spies without neon camouflage this time?
|Looks like Spies are becoming an Endangered Species. Send some more!
|(Tanya swears several times and is 'beeped' out) Sorry, Sir, but we need some more Spies.
|Hey! That's not Lincoln. They've put a Stalin head on him!
|Sir, several of our vehicles have been eaten by Terror Drones. Our Service Depot can remove the drones and save our vehicles.
|Commander, Niihau Island has fallen. We should prepare the rest of Hawaii for invasion.
|Commander, the Soviets have finished construction of a nuclear missile launcher on Niihau. We must build Gap Generators to hide our base before they can launch.
|Can't concentrate voices in my head_ _victory to the Soviet Union.
|victory to the Sov we're free! Get'em!
|Must reach the beacon just a little bit farther long live the glorious peoples Soviet state.
|We're going to need some help getting through those defenses.
|Hot Tamale! That's no Mayan Pyramid_ that's a Prism Cannon.
|Sir, these freedom fighters want to join up.
|What does this button do?
|Commander! Look out! They are over here.
|Get these commander! Here they are! Here!
|You should see this Commander!
|Please don't touch the auxiliary controls professor. They notify the commander of important events.
|Professor please stay off this channel.
|Professor Einstein! I'm sure the Commander sees that.
|Professor if you touch the controls again_
|Sir, if you build and deploy a spy satellite you will be able to see the entire combat area.
|We're rather low on resources in this location, sir. Perhaps you should construct an Ore Purifier so we can get more out of what we have.
|Commander, Marine World has loaned us their trained dolphins. They can be use a sonic enhancer to attack the Squids and drive them off our ships.
|Attemping to jam Soviet Command's calls for help, but a few got through. Heavier Soviet reinforcements arriving soon.
|Teleporting troops arriving in 5_ 4_ 3_ 2_ 1.
|Intercepting broadcast from Soviet Command. Romanov's panicking, sir. He's called for air evacuation. The transports will arrive in 2 minutes.
|Soviet evacuation transports arriving in 1 minute.
|Soviet evacuation transports arriving in 30 seconds.
|Sir, Romanov is calling for evacuation again. He is trying to escape.
|Psionic Amplifier captured. Soviet units are defecting to our side.
|Psionic Amplifier destroyed.
|Romanov captured.
|Teleporting troops arriving in 5_
|Chrono Reinforcements have arrived.
|Commander, the time to act is now. The bulk of our armies stand ready to be transported to this very location, but first Tanya must clear the way for them by eliminating the Psychic Amplifier.
|Tanya has failed, sir. Our best efforts have been all for naught.
|Sir, the Psychic Amplifier has been destroyed, and Soviet forces have begun to defect to our side!
|Our objective now is simple: Tanya must capture Romanov from his hiding place - the Kremlin.
|To capture Romanov, Tanya must enter the Kremlin.
|The Soviet High Command has been alerted to our presence. Prepare for a Soviet counter attack.
|With Romanov captured and being interrogated as we speak, it seems the Soviet menace has come to an end.
|We will never surrender! Death to the Allies!
|We can't let Romanov get away!
|I'm going to be sick.
|Where are we?
|Is this Russia?
|Commander, this is the first step in our glorious conquest. Victory here is crucial! Remember, we must crush the Pentagon - above all else, the Pentagon must be destroyed!
|We can't let a mere bridge delay our conquest, commander! Order your Engineers to enter the bridge's control station!
|Commander, pay no heed to casualties. For every Conscript who dies in the crusade, there are a thousand more who stand eager to replace him!
|Commander, you can order your Conscripts into nearby buildings to fortify them against the enemy.
|At last, the Pentagon is within our grasp! Destroy it, immediately.
|Ah... Our Comrades have decided to lend us support. These reinforcement Commander, are some of our most useful vehicles _ Flak Tracks! Their speed armor, and ability to carry infantry are the perfect support for our legion of Conscripts
|Superb, Commander! The Pentagon has been destroyed!
|Our base is out of power! We must build more generators to bring our radar and defenses back online!
|Be wary of those barrels of petrol! If damaged, they will surely explode violently. Perhaps we can use them to our advantage...
|Capture the airport commander in order to allow paratroopers to land in the area.
|Excellent, Comrade Commander! As soon as the Paratroopers are completely prepared, we will be able to strike anywhere you desire!
|The building that you've just discovered is one of America's special civilian buildings. Use an Engineer to convert the building and gain its powers.
|Deploy an occupied civilian structure to remove its occupants.
|This useful vehicle is known as a War Miner - it can be used to gather valuable minerals, and will defend itself with a turret-mounted cannon.
|To earn more credits, command your War Miners to gather ore.
|Iron Curtained units detected.
|Incoming Kirovs detected.
|You must destroy the Kremlin, where Yuri is cowering.
|(droned) By your command, Comrade.
|(droned) Death to the capitalists!
|(droned) Glory to Mother Russia!
|I will obey the Soviet ooh! where am I?
|Yes master
|Welcome to New York, Commander. Capture the Allied Battle Lab at the World Trade Center and use their technology to build the PSYCHIC BEACON
|The beacon is placed, Commander, but it needs time to charge. Keep theAllies from destroying the beacon.
|Beacon deployed and online.
|Excellent, Commander. Now use our new _conscripts_ to deal with theremaining Allied forces.
|Commander, capture these OIL DERRICKS for extra resources.
|Conscripts are more effective when garrisoned inside civilian buildings, Commander.
|Allied fleet has arrived.
|I have displayed the estimated time remaining until the Allied fleet arrives, Commander.
|The Allied air forces are threatening our position. Deploy our flak cannon and they will turn the enemy's air units into scrap metal.
|Commander, there is an AIRPORT somewhere nearby. Capture it and you will be able to airdrop Conscripts.
|Look for reinforcements stationed throughout the city, Commander.
|Be careful, Commander, once you reach the Paris Tower the Allied forces are like to rush your position.
|Get me close to the tower and I'll take care of the rest commander.
|A small reinforcement fleet of new Soviet Dreadnoughts has arrived. Use them for long range shore bombardment.
|Sources have reported that Allied troops are amassing outside their Chronosphere. A squad has just been teleported.
|Another enemy platoon has been teleported by the Chronosphere.
|One last Allied platoon has been teleported by the Chronosphere.
|Now that the beacon is destroyed, the Americans are free from Vladimir's mind control!
|Destroy monuments to receive a cash bonus from Moscow.
|Get me outta here!
|You Soviet scum, you'll never take me!
|They're breaking in! Do something!
|You don't want the Vice President running the country, do you!?
|<death>
|Get the President out of here! Go go go!
|Intelligence reports that there is another bridge south of your position.
|Yuri is in route to your position. Clear out the enemy defenses for his arrival.
|Careful not to destroy the bunker, Commander. We want the President alive for interrogation.
|The President is on the rescue ship. Sink the ship and we'll fish him from the water.
|Perhaps he needs some gentle persuasion.
|Greetings, Commander. Your forces need to invade the Allied base and take over their Battle Lab. Get an Engineer in there so we can pin-point the location of their Super Weapon.
|When your men are ready, I suggest you begin your assault here, Commander.
|This beach is well defended, but it is also the only place to land troops effectively. Good luck, Sir.
|Ah-ha, there it is! A Weather Control Device. Luckily Intel says that it couldn't possibly be operational yet. Take it out, Commander.
|Apparently our intelligence was wrong. Apologies, Commander. I'm now downloading schematics for a Nuclear Missile Silo so you can deal with this new threat.
|Perhaps I could be of assistance.
|Yuri will destroy us all. He must be stopped, no matter what the cost.
|(commenting on Yuri's invulnerable Iron Curtained soldiers) Commander, Yuri must be using an Iron Curtain device to make his troops invulnerable to attack! Intel indicates that the Iron Curtain effect can't possibly be maintained for long.
|Commander, looks like our Nuclear Silo has been noticed... Yuri's sending bunch of Kirovs our way!
|We'd better get some Flak Cannons in place.
|You don't really think that War Factory will help you defeat me, do you?
|So you're building a Kirov I'm impressed.
|I wouldn't build that Psychic Sensor if I were you.
|You're not really planning to nuke mother Russia, are you?
|Terror Drones are such mindless beasts. Why don't you train an Engineer instead?
|Now move up the coast. There is a small airfield there where we can build a base and reclaim our captured Kirov airships.
|They are using the Chronosphere to transport troops into our base! We cannot stop this assault. Attack soon, Commander, or we will be overrun!
|Good morning commander and welcome to basic training. There's a war on so we have to make this a crash course. In front of you is your battlefield control interface. With this interface you can command any soldier on the field. Let's begin with the new recruit you see in the center of your screen. Move him away from his barracks and out into the field. Left click on the soldier to select him. Then left click on empty ground to move him to that location. Try not to get him killed on the way to the shooting range.
|Notice how you can order your soldier to move into the dark area surrounding the base. This shroud indicates areas of the terrain that you have not yet explored.
|Now that you've mastered the difficult task (said sarcastically) of commanding a single soldier, try ordering around a squad. First, select all of the men by left clicking and holding down the mouse button. In this mode you can drag a selection box around all of your men. Select all of the soldiers at once and order them north to the bridge.
|This bridge was destroyed yesterday when the Navy SEALs used it for demolition practice. An engineer is en-route to repair it. When he arrives, left click on him to select him then left click on the repair hut next to the bridge. Once the bridge is repaired, move your men across.
|This is the shooting range. Select your men by drag-selecting a box around the group. Once selected, left click on the targets down range. This will order your men to fire at these targets. Destroy all of the targets.
|Excellent, your men are good shots. There is a row of targets just out of range of your GIs. Double click on one of your men. He will set himself up in a small defensive position. In this mode he can fire at a greater range. Many units have special abilities like this. Now, order him to destroy the remaining targets.
|Notice that one of your men has a special symbol on him when he is selected. This unit is a veteran unit. Veterans are tougher, stronger and can fire more accurately than ordinary soldiers. Double click on the man who is set up in a defense position to order him to move-out. Now order your men to move on down the road.
|In front of you is a derelict American Grizzly Battle Tank. Order your men to destroy the crippled tank.
|It takes your men longer to destroy the tank than the targets at the rifle range. Regular soldiers are not efficient at destroying armored units. In turn, armored units may not be the most effective weapons for destroying dug in infantry. Pick the right unit when facing enemies. Good job today, you have completed an important part of your training.
|Hurry up commander, you're boring me.
|Keep it moving commander, your training has to go quickly, the Reds are already landing on our shores.
|Commander, this is only one soldier. In a few days you will have to command armies. Now left click on him and then left click on open ground to get him moving out of the base.
|Today you will fight a mock battle against another commander. He will command the red team, you will command of the blue team. Select your Mobil Construction Vehicle by left clicking on it and order it to move out of the base. Get it a safe distance away and try to find some open ground.
|Your Mobile Construction Vehicle is now in open ground. Double click on it to deploy a Construction Yard.
|Now that you have a Construction Yard you can begin to build a base. On the right hand side of your screen you can see that the icon for a Power Plant has appeared. Left click on that icon to start construction of the power plant. Notice how your remaining money decreases while the Power Plant is building. Each building has a cost to construct. When the Power Plant is done building, left click on it's image and then left click on an empty area near your Construction Yard. If you see red squares where you are trying to place the power plant then you are either trying to place the Power Plant too far away from your Construction Yard or you are trying to build on uneven ground.
|Good, your base now has power and you are ready to build more structures. Each buiding you construct also has a power cost. If you run short of power for all of your buildings, some will stop working, and others will work inefficiently. Left click on the Ore Refinery Icon on the right hand side of your screen to build a refinery.
|Now that you have placed a Power Plant you can build a barracks. Many buildings and units depend on one another. You cannot build a barracks until you have built a Power Plant. You cannot train soldiers until you have a barracks. Left click on the barracks to start its construction. When it is finished place it on the terrain just like you did with the Refinery and Power Plant.
|On the right hand side of your screen you should see a button that looks like a soldier. When you press that button you will see the different types of soldiers that you can train. Right now all you can train is a GI. Left click on the GI to start training him. Left click multiple times to train a series of GIs.
|Red team may attack soon. Your GIs are armed with rubber bullets for this mission. In real combat they would of course be shooting real bullets.
|Here comes red team, make me proud commander.
|Red team's strike force has been defeated. Now build some more soldiers commander and when you feel you are ready, move them out onto the map. Find Red team's Command Center and destroy it.
|You really weren't ready for red team were you commander? If this had happened against the Soviets, your base would now be in flames. Red team will pull back to give you a chance to build some more troops.
|Good job commander, you have defeated the red team. Your basic training complete.
|Your new Chrono Miner will automatically begin to collect ore.
|WARNING: The Red Team invasion imminent.
|Deploy your GIs near the entrance to your base for a better defense.
|Send your troops to garrison inside the barn for better protection from enemy fire.
|Send your troops to garrison inside civilian structures for better protection from enemy fire.
|Now is not the time for potty breaks, Commander.
|No time to sit, Commander.
|WARNING: The stench of Red Team is in the air.
|Now that you'e mastered the difficult task (said sarcastically) of commanding a single soldier, try ordering around a squad. First, select all of the men by left clicking and holding down the mouse button. In this mode you can drag a selection box around all of your men. Select all of the soldiers at once and order them East to the bridge.
|Notice that one of your men has a special symbol on him when he is selected. This unit is a veteran unit. Veterans are tougher, stronger and can fire more accurately than ordinary soldiers. Double click on the man who is set up in a defense position to order him to move-out. Now order your men to move on up the road.
|Gosh darn it, I need more cash!
|Yippy-kai-aye, I'm going in!
|Anytime you want to get into the fight, just jump on in.
|Try to distract him, I've got a plan.
|If you give up now, I promise amnesty for you and your men.
|Hahahaha.
|That was a cowards tactic.
|It's too late to surrender now.
|I am running a little low of cash.
|Attention, I am about to attack.
|Your help would be greatly appreciated.
|Try to get the enemies attention, me and the lads are going to try something.
|Perhaps you should surrender, and avoid further bloodshed.
|Hahahaha.
|That was hardly fair, now was it?
|Heads up old boy, here I come.
|How can I fight without money?
|I attack, now!
|Help me you fool.
|If you would do something, I might do something.
|Surrender!
|Hahahaha.
|You cheap, sniveling little coward!
|As if there was ever any doubt.
|I have run out of money.
|I think I may actually attack.
|I'm getting slaughtered, I will have to surrender in moments.
|Distract our enemy and I may try something.
|Surrender! No, I don't mean I surrender. I mean you surrender.
|Hahahaha.
|Even a trained monkey could execute that maneuver.
|Are you ready for me to crush you like the bug that you are?
|I need money immediately.
|The time to attack is now.
|Send help or you will soon be on your own.
|Distract him, I have something _clever_ in mind.
|Surrender, you are all but beaten.
|Hahahaha.
|I will get you for that.
|Ah, victory.
|As unbelievable as it may seem, I am out of money.
|I am about to attack.
|You must send help, don't ask questions, just do as you are told.
|If you distract our enemy, I will execute my master plan.
|It will be very boring for me, but perhaps you should surrender.
|Hahahaha.
|I will make you pay for that.
|Is not my army beautiful? Behold as it destroys everything you own.
|My resources are exhausted.
|My men are ready, soon we will attack.
|My soldiers are being slaughtered, send help.
|Distract our enemy commander and I will destroy him.
|Surrender now and you will live.
|Hahahaha.
|That was without honor.
|You are doomed.
|I seem to be low on money.
|The order is given: Attack!
|Your assistance is required.
|You must distract our enemies while I make a secret attack.
|You are beaten! Surrender while you yet have buildings to sell!
|Hahahaha.
|What was that? You call that a tactic? You disgust me.
|Look at the battle, your doom is at hand.
|My resources are taxed to their limits.
|I will soon crush our enemies.
|Send me help comrade, before it is too late!
|Do something you idiot. I have a plan.
|If you surrender now, perhaps I will kill you quickly.
|Hahahaha.
|You are fool to try such tactics.
|There is no escape, there will be no mercy.

|In 1946 this man, Albert Einstein used this device to go back in time and forever alter history.
|This changed caused Jospeh Stalin to lead communist Russia in a major invasion of Europe.
|At first the Soviet invasion was successful, and soon it appeared that the British would be the last free people in Europe.
|But the European Allies rallied, and pushed back the Red menace finally smashing the communist war machine.
|After Stalin's disappearance this man, Alexandre Romanov, came to power with the blessing of Allied commanders.
|Romanov came from old aristocracy and though a member of the communist party, he was an advocate of peace.
|Current satellite intelligence indicates that Romanov may not be acting in good faith.
|Soviet warships have been spotted moving at high speed into the Atlantic.
|This man, known only as _Yuri_ may be responsible for shutting down our entire covert intelligence network in the Soviet Union.
|We have received almost no intelligence data from the Soviet Union in 6 months. Our agents are all missing or have been seen working with KGB operatives.
|All of this data can only mean one thing commander. Invasion.
|The following are technical specs on current battlefield weapon systems. Observe carefully commander, you may have to command these units in combat.
